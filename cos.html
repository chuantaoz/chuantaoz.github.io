						<p class="homeNewsDes">Chinese robotic vacuum cleaner makers are ratcheting up efforts to expand their presence in overseas markets amid rising global demand. Beijing Roborock Technology Co Ltd, for instance, saw its export revenue surge 124 percent year-on-year in the first six months to 1.26 billion yuan ($194.1 million).

						<p class="homeNewsDes">Since the COVID-19 outbreak over one and a half years ago, the global infections have topped 200 million while the death toll is nearing 4.3 million. In most places outside China, repeated lockdowns and massive vaccine rollout have failed to stop the spread of the pandemic. Under such circumstances, ozone, as an effective weapon with no side effects to inactivate the novel coronavirus, deserves more attention worldwide. On Feb. 18, 2020, during the initial stage of the epidemic, Zhou Muzhi, professor of Tokyo Keizai University and head of the Cloud River Urban Research Institute, published a paper titled "Ozone: A Powerful Weapon to Combat COVID-19 Outbreak" (hereafter referred to as the "February Zhou Paper"), calling for the use of the ozone to curb the spread of the disease. The paper has been reposted by many media outlets and platforms, thus promoting the ozone trials in combating the novel coronavirus.</p>
