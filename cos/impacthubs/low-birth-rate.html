			<p class="articleTitle2">Background</p>
			<p class="articleText">As the biggest city of china, Shanghai is facing a complex population problem. In 21st century, the population of Shanghai is growing rapidly because of migrants from other parts of China, and reaches more than 24 million in 2019. But the growth of the population of local people is almost 0. Shanghai has always been one of provinces with the lowest birth rate in China. The birth rate of Shanghai increased to 9.04‰ in 2016 as the two-child policy was implemented. However, the birth rate decreased again in the following years, reaching the lowest point of 6.24‰ at 2019.</p>

			<p class="articleText">According to a survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of births in China was 17.86 million in 2016, 17.23 million in 2017, 15.23 million in 2018, and 14.65 million in 2019. The number of newborns in China has been declining for four consecutive years. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences pointed out in the Green Paper released at the beginning of this year that China’s population will reach a peak of 1.442 billion in 2029 and will enter a continuous negative growth from 2030. The decrease in the birth population will inevitably have a profound impact on all aspects of China's future.</p>
			<p class="articleText">Netizens are reluctant to have children for two main reasons: the first is the pressure of life, and the second is the concept. It can be seen that the life and fertility concepts of the post-80s and post-90s are very different from those of the older generation. However, compared with social thoughts, the actual problem of "unable to feed" has a greater impact on fertility, which in turn affects social aspirations. In the survey, mentioning the "reasons for not wanting to have a baby", 60.07% of netizens chose "cannot afford to have a baby, dare not have a baby".</p>

			<p class="articleText">The cost of education is too high. According to data from the Ministry of Education, in the past 20 years, the number of public kindergartens in China has been relatively reduced, and the proportion of enrolled students has dropped from 95% to 44%. There are not enough public kindergartens and good enough public kindergartens. Many families can only choose more expensive private kindergartens, and the expenditure on pre-school education alone accounts for 26% of the family's annual income. Someone roughly calculated the cost of raising a single child and concluded that it would cost about 623,000 to 1.978 million. In addition, many parents also enroll their children in various tuition classes, special training classes, etc., which is not a small burden for ordinary families. A few years ago, an article titled "A month salary of 30,000 yuan, I still can't afford a child's summer vacation", once maxed out the circle of friends.</p>

			<p class="articleText">In this middle-class family in the article, the father takes care of the bulk of the family expenditure, and the mother has a monthly salary of 30,000, and only needs to manage the daily expenses of herself and her children. I used to be happy and happy, but suddenly I fell into a miserable situation, just because: the child is off for summer vacation. My mother calculated that the child’s summer vacation cost totaled 35,000, which was even higher than her monthly salary before tax. She couldn’t help feeling that her child was simply a "cash shredder."</p>
			<p class="articleText">Articles like "A monthly salary of tens of thousands can't afford to raise a baby" and "Parents are reluctant to drink milk tea for tuition" will be refreshed every once in a while, conveying a kind of anxiety all the time, children nowadays will think about it well in the future I have to do my best in life since I was young! This is a solidified society. The channels for class promotion have become narrower and narrower. It is even more difficult to cultivate an elite. Everyone is squeezing out a little bit of possible channels and educational resources... Next, more and more young people have the idea of not wanting to have children.</p>
			<p class="articleTitle2">Affecting fertility rate 2：</p>
			<p class="articleText">The cruel employment environment Queen Wang joined the new company in April and found out that she was pregnant in June. She wanted to wait for the child to reach 3 months before telling her leadership. But the strong morning sickness reaction was discovered by the department manager in advance. Because she had just joined the company not long ago and was still in the probation period, she was quickly dismissed as "not suitable for the position, not to be promoted". Miss Wang did not make any mistakes at work, but just because she was pregnant, she lost her job.</p>
			<p class="articleText">In the real society, men and women are completely unequal in their child rearing. This is why there is a saying of "widowed childcare"-that is, some fathers do not bear the responsibility of raising children at all, and the child seems to have no father. More or less affected women’s desire for reproduction.</p>
			<p class="articleTitle2">Affecting fertility rate 3：</p>
			<p class="articleText">Housing prices are the best contraceptive. In fact, the propensity to give birth to groups of different wealth levels are also different. Groups with the lowest economic level tend to be more inclined to have children. Concepts such as "raising children to prevent old age" are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. At the same time, it is also because the poorest groups do not have the concept of prenatal and postnatal care or even the conditions for contraception. This awareness of having fewer children. Groups with relatively high economic levels, such as many wealthy and prominent families, regard "prosperity of people" as one of their high expectations. Because for them, the level of wealth has reached a certain level, and raising many children will not become a burden. </p>

			<p class="articleText">The problem now is that the “overwhelming majority” of people are in the range where they have escaped from extreme poverty but are still far from rich. This is why the fertility rate in the entire society has generally fallen.</p>
			<p class="articleTitle2">Some explorations</p>
			<p class="articleText">Whether you can find a job, you can afford to read a book, you can afford to see a disease, you can afford to live in a house, you can afford to raise your old age, affects everyone's expectations of tomorrow, and the most relevant thing is the willingness to have children.</p>
			<p class="articleText">Wang Xiuzhi, an associate professor at the School of Economics and Management of Guangxi Normal University, said in an interview with the media that while the one-child policy is abolished, it is necessary to reduce birth costs, improve birth expectations, and gradually return the normal concept of fertility. The allocation of educational resources from kindergarten to high school, employment and unemployment protection, reduction of family tax burden, improvement of pension protection, housing reform, etc., require systematic advancement.</p>
			<p class="articleText">In 2018, the Liaoning Provincial Government issued the "Liaoning Province Population Development Plan (2016~2030)", which was the first to propose "exploring more incentive policies for families with two children to reduce the burden of having children." In recent years, more provinces are gradually exploring this road to achieve "better feeding" on the basis of "being able to live." In a word, if young people want to have more children, they must solve their worries. Without corresponding benefits and policies, the fertility rate will inevitably remain low.</p>
