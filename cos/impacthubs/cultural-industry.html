			<p class="articleTitle">Cultural Industry</p>
			<p class="articleTitle2">Background and current situation</p>
			<p class="articleText">In recent years, cultural and creative industries have become an important pillar industry of Shanghai's national economy. The total output of Shanghai's cultural and creative industries is RMB 104.33 billion, accounting for over 12% of the city's GDP; the added value of the industries is RMB 339.5 billion, up 8.2% year-on-year. In many cultural and creative industry categories, Shanghai has a good foundation.</p>
			<p class="articleText">Shanghai's cultural and film industry has also been developing rapidly, with its box office ranking first in China and the Shanghai International Film and TV Festival becoming a major film and TV cultural event of great influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy has chosen the animation and games and internet culture industries because of Shanghai's historical foundation and advantages in these areas, with the animation and games, internet audio-visual and internet literature industries currently ranking first in China and accounting for half of the country's total value.</p>

			<p class="articleTitle2">Reasons for the limited scale of Shanghai's cultural industry</p>
			<p class="articleText">Shanghai's cultural and creative industries are concentrated in the following two aspects: on the one hand, creative design that can enhance the energy level for industry, such as industrial design, arts and crafts design, brand and trademark design, advertising design, software design, etc.; on the other hand, creative design related to architecture, such as building design, infrastructure design, environmental design, urban design, etc. In terms of total output and value, the five industries of industrial design, architectural design, software and computer services, advertising and exhibition services and consulting services account for 76.27% of the total output and 73.84% of the total value added of the cultural and creative industries, constituting the main body of Shanghai's cultural and creative services. Although the traditional cultural industry represented by the art industry has made a big breakthrough compared to previous years, the art industry has not been the focus of Shanghai's cultural industry, nor has it received strong support from policies, and has been in a disadvantaged position.</p>
			<p class="articleText">From the perspective of the development of Shanghai's cultural and creative industry clusters themselves, there are still problems such as "emphasis on form but not industry", serious homogeneous competition, lack of distinctive industrial characteristics, low level of professional services, and management yet to be standardised and sound. At present, most of Shanghai's cultural and creative industrial parks are industrial clusters, and have not yet formed economic clusters with radiation linkage effect. The role of promoting urban transformation still remains at the industry level, with unclear strategic positioning and the traditional management system of compartmentalization forming a bottleneck.</p>
			<p class="articleText">Compared with science and technology parks, cultural and creative industry parks do not have special investment funds, nor are they included in the "Greater Zhangjiang" National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone, which is the "1+12" mainstream innovation system in Shanghai, and thus cannot enjoy more liberal and convenient policies. Support. As the main carrier of cultural and creative industries, the clustering areas are still in a "divided" situation of separate licensing and management.</p>

			<p class="articleTitle2">Problems with the cultural and art industry itself.</p>
			<p class="articleText">A cultural strategy is not a values clampdown and should be based on fully releasing the vitality of the art market as an intermediary institution. As the gallery industry involves both culture and commerce, government policy support is crucial. The gallery's flexibility as a primary market developer is its greatest strength. Small and medium-sized cultural enterprises often represent the dynamism of cultural innovation, and cultural development policies need to favour them and ensure their implementation, as a counterbalance to the monopolistic development of large capital in the free market. There is a simple and direct link between art market activity and the taxation status of artworks. An increase in taxation inhibits the growth of demand for art investment; conversely, a reduction in taxation results in a more active art trade, with people always preferring to trade where the conditions for sale are most favourable, especially for high-end art. Of all investment assets, the cultural and art market is one of the most internationally fluid, allowing investors to move their transactions or entire collections to other cities or countries to take advantage of favourable tax policies. </p>
			<p class="articleTitle2">Measures for Shanghai's cultural industries</p>
			<p class="articleText">Shanghai's "50 Cultural and Creative Industries" focus on 8 major fields, including film and television, performing arts, animation and games. As a typical comprehensive industry, the cultural and creative industries cover a wide range of areas and are rich in content. In the process of formulating industrial policies, it is necessary to highlight the key points and focus on them, so that limited resources can be focused on them and a point can lead to a surface. The "Article 50 of Cultural and Creative Industries" focuses on film and television, performing arts, animation and games, internet culture, creative design, publishing, art trading, cultural equipment and other fields. The focus areas can be found in the chart below, and the "1+3+x" development strategy will be discussed in detail later.</p>
			<p class="articleText">Shanghai film and television industry companies may benefit as the city builds a global film and television production centre. Shanghai puts "establishing a film and television production centre" in the first place. The film and television industry, as the focus of Shanghai's cultural and creative industries, is at the top of the list of "Shanghai's 50 Cultural and Creative Industries", many of which are closely related to the Shanghai International Film Festival. Shanghai now produces 80 films a year, which is about one seventh of the national total (600 films). Of course, not all of these films are shot on location in Shanghai, nor are they all produced in Shanghai in post-production. Therefore, the idea of promoting the construction of a global film and television production centre in the "50 Articles of Shanghai Culture and Creativity" is to "build a nest to attract phoenixes", to attract more film crews and films to come to Shanghai to shoot their films, and thus to drive the film and television industry in Shanghai to develop better and faster.</p>
