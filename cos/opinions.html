							<p class="opinionDes">Our world has reached an agonizing milestone:  the loss of one million lives from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s a mind-numbing figure.  Yet we must never lose sight of each and every individual life.  They were fathers and mothers, wives and husbands, brothers and sisters, friends and colleagues. The pain has been multiplied by the savageness of this disease. Risks of infection kept families from bedsides.  And the process of mourning and celebrating a life was often made impossible. How do you say goodbye without holding a hand, or extending a gentle kiss, a warm embrace, a final whispered “I love you”?    And still there is no end in sight to the spread of the virus, the loss of jobs, the disruption of education, the upheaval to our lives. “ We can overcome this challenge. But we must learn from the mistakes.  Responsible leadership matters.  Science matters.  Cooperation matters — and misinformation kills.  As the relentless hunt for a vaccine continues — a vaccine that must be available and affordable to all —let’s do our part to save lives.  Keeping physical distance.  Wearing a mask.  Washing hands.</p>

							<p class="opinionDes">For a long time, China has implemented the policy of payment before treatment, which is conducive to guiding patients to rational drug use and safeguarding the rights and interests of both doctors and patients. However, when a variety of unknown diseases and the need to advance huge medical costs, will lead to some patients give up treatment. Therefore, it is recommended to ensure that medical institutions treat patients first and charge them later in emergencies such as outbreaks of epidemic diseases.</p>

							<p class="opinionDes">Timely activation of the emergency response mechanism is the key to strictly controlling the consequences of a major epidemic. Therefore, emergency measures should be further refined. At the same time, it is necessary to fundamentally solve the phenomenon that the emergency plan is not useful, the upper and lower are generally rough, and even put into the shelf, so as to improve the quality and operability of the emergency plan. In addition, emergency drills should be further strengthened to ensure effective response and orderly operation under abnormal conditions. Practice shows that, if not at ordinary times, urgent must show incompetence. Major epidemic outbreaks, tend to be a huge impact on the economic and social operation, the effective mechanism of normal may lose normal function, this makes establish emergency response mechanism to improve national governance system and the promotion of the important content of management ability, if no emergency mechanism necessary exercise at ordinary times, this mechanism can't work after the outbreak of an epidemic. Therefore, strengthening emergency drills under normal conditions can not only update the emergency response mechanism with The Times, but also enhance people's vigilance against major epidemics. To cultivate a team of high quality talents who dare to take responsibility.</p>

							<p class="opinionDes">Soft power is a city's highest order of competitiveness, influence and attractiveness. It influences the public perception of a city in a "silent" way, shaping the city's discourse globally with its soft power and clearly communicating its values through the mists of history to shape a great city. It can be argued that if Shanghai is to represent China and tell the story of governance globally, it must put soft power building on its key agenda.</p>

							<p class="opinionDes">When we travel through all the beautiful cities in the world, we are always attracted by their stunning landscapes, classic architecture, individual industries and livable spaces. And Fengxian has its own unique temperament in these aspects as well. Located on the East China Sea and Hangzhou Bay, Fengxian has an ecological space with access to the river and the sea, a world of trees, a sea of flowers, a paradise for birds, a home of clouds and a paradise for people; it has the "Great Wall of the Sea", one of the three major municipal buildings in ancient China, which is a key cultural heritage currently being excavated and developed by the Shanghai Municipal Government and Fengxian District Government. The "Oriental Beauty Valley" is the capital of China's cosmetic industry, with its cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries, and it is also the centre of South Shanghai according to the Shanghai 2035 Master Plan.</p>

							<p class="opinionDes">With new technologies, new industries and new models emerging, data and information have become important factors of production, and digitisation has redefined productivity, production relations and social structures. Digitisation unifies smart manufacturing, smart cities, resource allocation mechanisms, infrastructure and residents in an interdependent and efficient network. Digitisation is both a key path to enhancing the capacity of cities to allocate resources and offers new opportunities for diversity, interconnectivity and further development. Promoting digital transformation across the board is a key step towards upgrading the city's capacity and enhancing its core competitiveness. At the same time, the digital transformation of the city is also important for Shanghai to serve the new development pattern and play a leading and functional role in creating a "central node" in the domestic circulation and a "strategic link" in the dual domestic and international circulation.</p>

They will justifiably sit in judgment on our failure to have prevented its devastating consequences knowing that we chose to look the other way.</p>
