			<p class="articleText">Chinese robotic vacuum cleaner makers are ratcheting up efforts to expand their presence in overseas markets amid rising global demand. Beijing Roborock Technology Co Ltd, for instance, saw its export revenue surge 124 percent year-on-year in the first six months to 1.26 billion yuan ($194.1 million). That accounts for about half the company's overall revenue. Roborock's products are now available in more than 100 countries and regions. The company is also steadily expanding retail channels in Europe, Southeast Asia and other regions. As at the end of June, the company had established branches in the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, South Korea and elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="articleText">Chang Jing, chairman and CEO of Beijing Roborock Technology, said the company is positioned to be midrange to high-end global intelligent hardware company with a long-term goal of being midrange to high-end technology innovation company. According to Research and Markets, the global robotic vacuum cleaner market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23.2 percent from 2021 to 2028 to reach $15.4 billion by 2028. The increasing popularity of intelligent vacuum cleaners featuring voice control and smart navigation functionality is expected to drive global demand for such products, the research firm added. Technical upgrades, such as artificial intelligence features and smart navigation to avoid collisions with obstacles, and technology that leaves carpets cleaner, are being implemented in the new robotic vacuums to meet evolving consumer needs. Additionally, the increasing adoption of smart household appliances for performing household chores and addressing busy consumer lifestyles support the growth of the robotic vacuum cleaner market. The COVID-19 pandemic has opened new avenues for players operating in the robotic vacuum cleaner market. Industry players witnessed increased sales of such appliances starting from the second quarter of 2020 due to the need for cleanliness and hygiene in homes and commercial spaces. Consumers purchased robotic vacuums to prevent the spread of the virus in their homes and workplaces. These devices can efficiently clean and mop floors by reaching below beds, cupboards and tables. Also, work-from-home settings have compelled consumers to keep homes tidier due to longer periods spent at home.</p>
			<p class="articleText">David Qian, CEO of Ecovacs Robotics, said the COVID-19 outbreak has brought more long-term growth points than challenges to the service robotics market. "Home service robots are designed to help consumers improve their daily lives and adopt new lifestyles. During the prevention and control of the pandemic, some people have improved their health consciousness. This will boost demand for smart household appliances," Qian said, adding that the company is also expanding its overseas presence.</p>
